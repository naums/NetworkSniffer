# NetworkSniffer

## Background

These applications were part of my bachelor thesis. The Thesis was about dependebility modelling for distributed systems and handled the topic of using network traces (so captured network-packages) for creating a model from the distributed application and compute some dependability data from that. There were several ideas for computation:

* Bridge Detection
* Faultree generation from the dependency graphs
* calculating failure probabilities for the edges with the sent and received packages (may be impossible with PCAP-library)
